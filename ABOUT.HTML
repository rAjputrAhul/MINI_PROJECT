            This is an institution based LOST AND FOUND website for the students of
            Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology which will help them to
            report a lost/found item inside the campus and help each other find their
            lost things. Here, a user is given interface for registering a lost/found
            item by entering its details, listing, and searching its properties in a
            database with admin. This website is constructed with HTML, CSS and PHP.
            Students may often lose important things like documents, notebooks, ID-cards
            etc, and this website can be of great help to everyone. Firstly the users
            will register (if they are new to the website), else login and post about
            the lost or found item.
